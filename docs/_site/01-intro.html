<!-- ## Preliminaries -->

<h2 id="venue-date-and-time">Venue, date and time</h2>

<p>Basic Statistics is the second half of the BSc (Hons) Biostats core module, and will run from 9 April to 20 April 2018. This workshop will take place each day from <strong>9:00–16:00</strong>. There will be an assignment due about six weeks after the end of this module, and it will provide the other half of the marks for the Biostats module. More on the assignment later.</p>

<h2 id="course-outline">Course outline</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction (this chapter)</li>
  <li>Types of data</li>
  <li>Descriptive statistics: Measures of location and dispersion</li>
  <li>Representing data graphically</li>
  <li>The Normal distribution and probability determination using the normal curve</li>
  <li>T-tests (one-sample, two-sample and paired)</li>
  <li>Confidence intervals</li>
  <li>One-way ANOVA</li>
  <li>Multivariate ANOVA</li>
  <li>Repeated measures ANOVA (or rather LME?)</li>
  <li>Testing data for normality and transforming data</li>
  <li>Non-parametric tests—Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis (or rather GLM?)</li>
  <li>Chi square tests</li>
  <li>Correlation</li>
  <li>Linear regression</li>
</ol>

<p>The course content can broadly be classified into two parts: <em>Descriptive Statistics</em> and <em>Inferential Statistics</em>.</p>

<p>Descriptive statistics and their associated statistical and graphical data summaries will be covered in Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 5 we will introduce the concepts of data distributions, knowledge of which is required to select the most appropriate inferential statistical methods.</p>

<p>Chapters 6-15 are about inferential statistics. Inferential tests allow us to evaluate hypotheses within a framework of probabalistic theory, which helps us infer the nature of a ‘population’ based on a smaller represenative set of samples. In partiucular, we can infer whether the property under scrutiny (arrived at by means of a designed experiment or a directed sampling programme) occured as a result of deterministic influences, or whether it is as a result of chance.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-workshop">About this Workshop</h2>

<p>The aim of this five-day introductory workshop is to guide you through the outline given above.</p>

<!-- AJS to update -->

<h2 id="this-is-biology-why-more-r-coding">This is biology: why more R coding?</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://robwschlegel.github.io/Intro_R_Workshop/">Intro R Workshop: Data Manipulation, Analysis and Graphing</a> for why we feel strongly that you use R [@R2017] for the analyses that we will perform here. All of the reasons provided there are valid here too, but one reason perhaps more so than others—R and RStudio promote the principles of <em>reproducible research</em>, and in fact make it very easy to implement. We will focus on some of these principles throughout the workshop, and the assignments will require that you submit a fully functional working script, complete with all the notes, memos, examples, data, executable code, and output that will result from completing the course material.</p>

<p>What other options are there for analysing the kinds of data that we will encounter in biological research? Software packages like the ones you may be familiar with, such as Statistica and SPSS, are often used to perform many of these analyses. They are rather limited with regards to the full scope of modern statistical methods in use by biologists today, but many people still use these kinds of software as they provide the basic kinds analyses that still form the staple of the biological and medical sciences. For the many reasons provided above, we prefer to use R as the <em>engine</em> within which to do our biological data analysis. R is used by academic statisticians the world over, and it is therefore an excellent choice for our purpose here.</p>

<h2 id="installing-r-and-rstudio">Installing R and RStudio</h2>

<p>We assume that you already have R installed on your computer, as all of you will have already completed the the Intro R Workshop. If you need a refresher, please refer to <a href="https://robwschlegel.github.io/Intro_R_Workshop/">Intro R Workshop: Data Manipulation, Analysis and Graphing</a> for the installation instructions.</p>

<h2 id="style-and-code-conventions">Style and code conventions</h2>

<p>Early on, develop the habit of unambiguous and consistent style and formatting when writing your code, or anything else for that matter. Pay attention to detail and be pedantic. This will benefit your scientific writing in general. Although many R commands rely on precisely formatted statements (code blocks), style can nevertheless to <em>some extent</em> have a personal flavour to it. The key is <em>consistency</em>. In this book we use certain conventions to improve readability. We also use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code, and in particular to typed commands and package names.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Package names are shown in a bold font over a grey box, <em>e.g.</em> <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">tidyr</code></strong>.</li>
  <li>Functions are shown in normal font followed by parentheses and also over a grey box , <em>e.g.</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot()</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">summary()</code>.</li>
  <li>Other R objects, such as data, function arguments or variable names are again in normal font over a grey box, but without parentheses, <em>e.g.</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">apples</code>.</li>
  <li>Sometimes we might directly specify the package that contains the function by using two colons, <em>e.g.</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">dplyr::filter()</code>.</li>
  <li>Commands entered onto the R command line (console) and the output that is returned will be shown in a code block, which is a light grey background with code font. The commands entered start at the beginning of a line and the output it produces is preceded by <code class="highlighter-rouge">R&gt;</code>, like so:</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also insert maths expressions within the text, like this $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$ or on their own, like this: <script type="math/tex">f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}</script></p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-teaching-philosophy">Assessment and teaching philosophy</h2>
<p>Grades will be based on performance of two take home exams, and an individual project and homework problem sets. The exams and individual project will represent 30% of the grade. The homework problem sets will make up the remaining 10%. In cases where students are borderline between lower and higher grades, a high level of participation in the class discussions and class in general will win the day for the higher grade.</p>

<p>Homework problems are essential to understanding of the materials. Although the homework comprises only 10% of the final grade, performance on the exams is usually correlated with effort on the homework problems.</p>

<p>Whereas plagiarism will not be tolerated, students ARE encouraged to work together to learn from one another (especially those from the same IVN site) and solve problems in a collaborative and collegial way (aside from the take home exam).</p>

<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>

<p>This document, which as available as an HTML file that’s viewable on a web browser of your choice (anything will do, but we discourage using Internet Explorer) and as a PDF (accessible from the link at the top of any of the website’s pages) that may be printed, was prepared by the software tools available to R via RStudio. We use the package called <code class="highlighter-rouge">bookdown</code> that may be accessed and read about <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">here</a> to produce this documentation. The entire source code to reproduce this book is available from my <a href="https://github.com/ajsmit/Basic_stats">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
