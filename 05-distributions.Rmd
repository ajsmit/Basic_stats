```{r prelim-opts, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "R>", 
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE
)
```

Therefore, we must next learn about the different types of data distributions we are likely to encounter in the wild.

## Binomial distribution

## Poisson distribution

## Continuous uniform distribution

## Exponential distribution

## Normal distribution

## Chi-squared distribution

## Student t distribution

## F distribution
